This is **Jing Zhou (周晶)**, currently a researcher in the School of Automation, Central South University in China. 

I obtained my Ph.D degree in control systems from the University of Alberta, Canada, in 2022. From Sept. 2022 to July 2024, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the department of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Alberta. After holding a 6-month postdoctoral position in the department of biomedical engineering at City University of Hong Kong, I joined Central South University in March 2025. I was the awardee of the Excellent Young Scientists Fund (Overseas) in 2024.
